A Python program that creates a dictionary containing course numbers and room numbers of the rooms where the courses meet. The dictionary will have key-value pairs and a dictionary containing course numbers and 
names of the instructors that teach each course, including key-value pairs. The program will also include a dictionary containing each course's course numbers and meeting times with key-value pairs. 
The user will enter a course number, and then it will display the course's room number, instructor, and meeting time. 

Error handling for when the user inputs a course number: It is converted to uppercase using the .upper() method. This ensures that the program correctly handles inputs regardless of whether they 
are entered in uppercase, lowercase, or a combination of both.
The program uses a while loop to prompt users to enter a course number or type 'quit' to exit. If the user enters 'quit,' the loop breaks and the program ends. Otherwise, it displays the details for 
the entered course number.
